# Investment-Service-System

This is an Investment Service web application to bridge the information gap between the investors and companies. The app provides access to the information of main organizations in USA so that it can be easily discovered by both investors and companies. We plan to use companies data from the website Crunchbase downloaded from their data dump. Based on the data we found (which are in separate .csv files), we need to re-partition and map them together so it would follow the relational database design. 
 
Using our web application, investors can search and filter companies that they are interested in investing by many factors, such as location, funding rounds, last funding date. For companies that are seeking for investment, it can also search for the information of venture corporations including their url, description and the companies that they have invested. 
For example, an investor in Minnesota can use the drop-down box to find companies located in Twin Cities, and have completed 2 Rounds funding. The website also provides more detailed information of the filtered companies as well, such as the short description, first/last funding time, status, etc.
